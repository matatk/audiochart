AudioChart
===========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/matatk/audiochart.svg?branch=gh-pages)](https://travis-ci.org/matatk/audiochart)

Allows the user to explore charts on web pages using sound and the keyboard rather than, or in conjunction with, visually and with the mouse.  The code can easily be added to any page containing charts.

Thanks to [The Paciello Group](http://paciellogroup.com) for allowing me to share this with you, and to [The Sonification Handbook](http://sonification.de/handbook/) for the research behind it.

AudioChart uses the Web Audio API, which has [great support amongst browsers, including Microsoft Edge](http://caniuse.com/audio-api), though is not (yet) supported by Internet Explorer.

Use Cases and Examples
-----------------------

What does it let your users do?

 * Play an auditory version of the data represented by a Google Chart, JSON fragment or HTML table.

What sort of charts/data does it work with?

 * Google Charts line and bar charts.
 * JSON (the format is detailed in the examples gallery).
 * HTML tables.

The [examples gallery](http://matatk.agrip.org.uk/audiochart/examples/examples-gallery.html) covers using AudioChart with Google Charts, JSON and HTML tables.

"Hello, World" Tutorial (using Google Charts)
----------------------------------------------

You can check out the finished ["hello, world" HTML file](http://matatk.agrip.org.uk/audiochart/examples/hello-world-tutorial.html).  Note that you can also use AudioChart with JSON and HTML tables (there are [examples](http://matatk.agrip.org.uk/audiochart/examples/examples-gallery.html) to demonstrate this).

### Google Charts Bits

More details on this can be found in the [Google Charts documentation](https://developers.google.com/chart/).

 1. Load the Google Charts API.

    ```html
    <script src="https://www.google.com/jsapi"></script>
    ```

 2. Have an element in your document to contain the chart.

    ```html
    <div id="chart"></div>
    ```

 3. Instantiate the Google Charts API and hook it up to a function to draw the chart when the page has loaded (you could put this code in a `<script>` element in your document's `<head>`, for example).

    ```javascript
    google.load('visualization', '1.0', {'packages':['corechart']});
    google.setOnLoadCallback(draw_chart);

    function draw_chart() {
    	. . .
    }
    ```

    The rest of the JavaScript code goes inside `draw_chart()`.

 4. Create a Google Charts API `DataTable` and populate it with some data.

    ```javascript
    var data = new google.visualization.DataTable();

    data.addColumn('string', 'Top Secret Evil Project');
    data.addColumn('number', 'Watermelons');
    data.addRows([
    	['Alpha',   293],
    	['Beta',    329],
    	['Gamma',   261],
    	['Delta',   130],
    	['Epsilon', 196],
    	['Zeta',    196],
    ]);
    ```

    Note that there are other ways to add data to `DataTable` objects; the [AudioChart examples](http://matatk.agrip.org.uk/audiochart/examples/examples-gallery.html) include a sine wave, generated by code, and the [DataTable documentation](https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/reference#DataTable) gives other approaches.

 5. Prepare chart options and create a Google Charts API chart.

    ```javascript
    var chart_options = {
    	'title': 'Evil Project Efficacy',
    	'width': 800,
    	'height': 450,
    	'curveType': 'function'
    };

    var chart = new google.visualization.LineChart(document.getElementById('chart'));
    chart.draw(data, chart_options);
    ```

### AudioChart Bits

 1. Load AudioChart.

    ```html
    <script src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matatk/audiochart/gh-pages/lib/audiochart.min.js"></script>
    ```

 2. Create an element in your document to trigger audio playback.

    ```html
    <button id="play">Play</button>
    ```

 3. Wire up the button, data table and chart to AudioChart; include the following code in `draw_chart()`.  The `chart` is passed in so that AudioChart can visually highlight the chart data points during playback (this is optional).

    ```javascript
    document.getElementById('play').onclick = function() {
    	new AudioChart({
    		'type': 'google',      // (see the docs)
    		'data': data,          // the GoogleDataTable
    		'chart': chart,        // the Google Chart object
    		'duration': 5000,      // milliseconds
    		'frequencyLow': 200,   // Hz
    		'frequencyHigh': 600   // Hz
    	});
    }
    ```

#### Other Chart Types and Options

The [REFERENCE](REFERENCE.md) details all the options you can pass to AudioChart.

Components
-----------

The following objects are present in [AudioChart (JavaScript code)](src/audiochart.js).

 * A `DataWrapper` interface wraps third-party chart library/other data sources.
    - `GoogleDataWrapper` wraps Google Charts `DataTable` objects.
    - `JSONDataWrapper` wraps JSON strings or parsed/compatible objects.
    - `HTMLTableWrapper`
 * A `PitchMapper` maps from data values to pitches.
    - `FrequencyPitchMapper` does basic interpolation.
 * The `WebAudioSounder` wraps the Web Audio API.
 * The `Player` brings together wrapped data source, mapper and sounder.
 * The `AudioChart` object provides the public-facing interface.

Development
------------

A Gruntfile is provided to run the tests and automate things like linting and minification.  [Unit tests can be run in-browser](http://matatk.agrip.org.uk/audiochart/test/) or via the Gruntfile, printing output to the terminal.  You can also view the [test coverage details](http://matatk.agrip.org.uk/audiochart/test/coverage/).

Development is carried out in a [test-driven](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) manner.  The `pre-commit` hook can be used to ensure only code that passes tests is committed.  You can make a symlink from the `.git/hooks/` directory to it and thus it (and the tests) will be run before you are asked for a commit message.

### Setting up for development

The build process uses Grunt and therefore also Node.  You can get set up for development as follows (most of these instructions require the use of a command line).

 1. Install [Node](https://nodejs.org/) (if you're a Mac user doing this via [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) is recommended: `brew install node`).
 2. Install [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) globally via `npm -g install grunt-cli` in order to be able to run the `grunt` command in any directory.
 3. Get AudioChart's code by using `git clone https://github.com/matatk/audiochart.git` or [downloading a ZIP of the latest code](https://github.com/matatk/audiochart/archive/gh-pages.zip).
 4. Locally install AudioChart's dependencies by running `npm install` in the newly-cloned/extracted `audiochart/` directory (the packages will be stored inside `node_modules/`).
 5. Running `grunt` will lint the code, run the tests and make a minified production version.

**Windows users:** this has not yet been extensively tested on Windows, but it doesn't use anything platform-specific, so should work fine. Please file a bug if you encounter any problems.

Future Work Ideas
------------------

Patches for and feedback on the following are welcome!

 * Play speed/duration.
 * Support [Google Chart Web Component (Polymer)](https://github.com/GoogleWebComponents/google-chart) charts.
 * Support [C3.js](http://c3js.org) charts.
 * Support SVG charts.
 * Static/Periodic features such as grid/timing beats.
 * Mouse hover "audition" mode (hovering the mouse over a point would sound it).
 * Rendering a visual highlight element for chart APIs that don't provide this (i.eJSON and HTML tables).
 * Multiple plots/data series per chart.
 * Instruments as different sound types.
 * Officially support development on Windows.
 * Create a browser extension to enable AudioChart on charts/tables for sites that don't provide it themselves.
 * Allow modular builds to be created, with only support for data sources relevant to your site/application.
 * Make AudioChart a bower package and explain how it can be easily added to any page that way.

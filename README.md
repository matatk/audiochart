AudioChart
===========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/matatk/audiochart.svg?branch=gh-pages)](https://travis-ci.org/matatk/audiochart)

Allows the user to explore charts on web pages using sound and the keyboard rather than, or in conjunction with, visually and with the mouse.  The code can easily be added to any page containing charts.

AudioChart uses the Web Audio API, which has [great support amongst browsers, including Microsoft Edge](http://caniuse.com/audio-api), though is not (yet) supported by Internet Explorer.  

Thanks to [The Paciello Group](http://paciellogroup.com) for allowing me to share this with you, and to [The Sonification Handbook](http://sonification.de/handbook/) for the research behind it.

Use Cases and Examples
-----------------------

What does it let your users do?

 * Play an auditory version of the data represented by a Google Chart, JSON fragment or HTML table.

What sort of charts/data does it work with?

 * Google Charts line and bar charts.
 * JSON (the format is detailed in the examples gallery).
 * HTML tables.

The [examples gallery](http://matatk.agrip.org.uk/audiochart/examples/examples-gallery.html) covers using AudioChart with Google Charts, JSON and HTML tables.

Tutorial and Documentation
---------------------------

- The ["Hello, World" AudioChart and Google Charts tutorial](http://matatk.agrip.org.uk/audiochart/examples/hello-world-tutorial.html) demonstrates how to get started.
- [AudioChart options reference](REFERENCE.md)
- [Public API documentation](http://matatk.agrip.org.uk/audiochart/doc/public/)

Development
------------

A Gruntfile is provided to run the tests and automate things like linting and minification.  [Unit tests can be run in-browser](http://matatk.agrip.org.uk/audiochart/test/) or via the Gruntfile, printing output to the terminal.  You can also view the [test coverage details](http://matatk.agrip.org.uk/audiochart/test/coverage/).

Development is carried out in a [test-driven](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) manner.  The `pre-commit` hook can be used to ensure only code that passes tests is committed.  You can make a symlink from the `.git/hooks/` directory to it and thus it (and the tests) will be run before you are asked for a commit message.

### Setting up for development

The build process uses Grunt and therefore also Node.  You can get set up for development as follows (most of these instructions require the use of a command line).

 1. Install [Node](https://nodejs.org/) (if you're a Mac user doing this via [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) is recommended: `brew install node`).
 2. Install [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) globally via `npm -g install grunt-cli` in order to be able to run the `grunt` command in any directory.
 3. Get AudioChart's code by using `git clone https://github.com/matatk/audiochart.git` or [downloading a ZIP of the latest code](https://github.com/matatk/audiochart/archive/gh-pages.zip).
 4. Locally install AudioChart's dependencies by running `npm install` in the newly-cloned/extracted `audiochart/` directory (the packages will be stored inside `node_modules/`).
 5. Running `grunt` will lint the code, run the tests and make a minified production version.

**Windows users:** this has not yet been extensively tested on Windows, but it doesn't use anything platform-specific, so should work fine. Please file a bug if you encounter any problems.

Future Work Ideas
------------------

Patches for and feedback on the following are welcome!

 * Play speed/duration.
 * Support [Google Chart Web Component (Polymer)](https://github.com/GoogleWebComponents/google-chart) charts.
 * Support [C3.js](http://c3js.org) charts.
 * Support SVG charts.
 * Static/Periodic features such as grid/timing beats.
 * Mouse hover "audition" mode (hovering the mouse over a point would sound it).
 * Rendering a visual highlight element for chart APIs that don't provide this (i.eJSON and HTML tables).
 * Multiple plots/data series per chart.
 * Instruments as different sound types.
 * Officially support development on Windows.
 * Create a browser extension to enable AudioChart on charts/tables for sites that don't provide it themselves.
 * Allow modular builds to be created, with only support for data sources relevant to your site/application.
 * Make AudioChart a bower package and explain how it can be easily added to any page that way.

<p id="intro">Allows the user to explore charts on web pages using sound and the keyboard rather than, or in conjunction with, visually and with the mouse.  The code is <a href="https://github.com/matatk/audiochart">developed on GitHub</a> and can easily be added to any page containing charts (or HTML tables or JSON data).  A <a href="examples/hello-world-tutorial.html">tutorial</a> and <a href="examples/examples-gallery.html">examples</a> are available.</p>

	<p>Thanks to <a href="http://paciellogroup.com">The Paciello Group</a> for allowing me to share this with you, and to <a href="http://sonification.de/handbook/">The Sonification Handbook</a> for the research behind it.</p>
	<p>AudioChart uses the Web Audio API, which has <a href="http://caniuse.com/audio-api">great support amongst browsers, including Microsoft Edge</a>, though is not supported by Internet Explorer.</p>

	<h2>What does it do for you?</h2>
	<p>It augments charts you may already have on your page (or those that you create) with sounds that represent the data in the chart.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Supports charts made with Google Charts API as well as JSON structures and HTML tables.</li>
		<li>Can highlight the data visually on the chart during playback (Google Charts only).</li>
	</ul>
	<p>More information (including planned work) can be found <a href="https://github.com/matatk/audiochart#audiochart">in the README</a>.</p>

	<h2>Tutorial and Examples</h2>
	<p>The <a href="examples/examples-gallery.html">Examples Gallery</a> contains line and bar Google Charts, JSON- and HTML table-based examples.  Steps to create the <a href="examples/hello-world-tutorial.html">Google Charts-based "Hello, world" example</a> are described in the <a href="https://github.com/matatk/audiochart#hello-world-tutorial-using-google-charts">tutorial section of the README</a>.</p>

	<h2>Code Testing</h2>
	<p>You can <a href="test/">run the unit tests in-browser</a> or via the command line if you have the required tools and package installed (as detailed in the <a href="https://github.com/matatk/audiochart#development">development information section of the README</a>).  Also available online are the <a href="test/coverage/">test coverage details</a>.</p>
